            <b>Project Idea</b> 
        </h3>
        <p>The world's production and consumption of plastic products is becoming an ever-increasing problem as we learn more and more about
            the difficulties of recycling, microplastics, and the general harm that plastics do to our environment. There are many different metrics
            that we could have tracked and visualized, but we chose just a few key metrics to provide a hgih-level overview of the world's plastics issues. More specifically,
            this project highlights the increasing disparity between plastic production and plastic recycling efforts, the share of plastic exports by country/continent/income level,
            and how much waste is produced by each country around the world.</p>

            <b>Project Significance/Broader Impacts</b> 
        </h3>
        <p>This project seeks to inform others and generate awareness about some of the fundamental issues regarding plastic across the globe. This project highlights
            the disporportionate impact that many upper-income and highly developed countries contribute to the world's plastic woes.

            <b>Intended Audience</b> 
        </h3>
        <p>Our intended audience includes everyone from the average person to the highest level of policymaker. Living sustainably and reducing environmental impact is important for the individual,
            but it is also important for nations to prioritize this as well.</p>
