            <b>Project Idea</b> 
        </h3>
        <p>To target the great concern of plastic pollution, we planned to create a website that includes an interactive map with clickable buttons, as well as interactive charts that highlight different information about pollution, including tracking pollution over the years and pollution exports. Our project desires to demonstrate which countries pollute the most, and how it has changed for the better or worse. Our project wants to put emphasis on the global plastic pollution crisis. We hope that others can take-away from this the consciousness to live sustainably.</p>

            <b>Project Significance/Broader Impacts</b> 
        </h3>
        <p>To avoid generating unnecessary impacts on communities and countries, we will be careful when considering the ethics of how the waste got there, and who contributed to it. We promise to acknowledge that plastic is also emitted domestically and to acknowledge that countries may have indirect impact on the pollution rates of another country.</p>

        <h3>
            <b>Functions</b> 
        </h3>
        <p>One of the primary functions is to demonstrate pollution rates around the world, but we also hope to be able to have clickable regions of top plastic polluting countries that allow the user to have a further peek of the breakdown of all the types of pollution occurring in that country. To track plastic pollution, we hope to use a dataset by Our World in Data that highlights different metrics like plastic emitted into oceans, mismanaged waste, and waste trade. Another dataset from Statista highlights pollution worldwide, sorted into air, land, and water. It would be useful to be able to take this data to demonstrate the different types of pollution occurring in a country.</p>

        <h3>
            <b>Intended Audience</b> 
        </h3>
        <p>Our targeted audience is worldwide consumers. We hope to get attention to convince people to start caring about environmental issues. Although pollution is such a global issue, we believe that change can start with the people. If people care, then governments will care. With this project, we hope to gather attention on this crisis.</p>
