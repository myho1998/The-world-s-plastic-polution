            <b>Project Idea</b> 
        </h3>
        <p>To target the great concern of plastic pollution, we planned to create a website that includes an interactive map with clickable buttons, as well as interactive charts that highlight different information about pollution, including tracking pollution over the years and pollution exports. Our project desires to demonstrate which countries pollute the most, and how it has changed for the better or worse. Our project wants to put emphasis on the global plastic pollution crisis. We hope that others can take-away from this the consciousness to live sustainably.</p>

            <b>Project Significance/Broader Impacts</b> 
        </h3>
        <p>To avoid generating unnecessary impacts on communities and countries, we will be careful when considering the ethics of how the waste got there, and who contributed to it. We promise to acknowledge that plastic is also emitted domestically and to acknowledge that countries may have indirect impact on the pollution rates of another country.</p>

            <b>Intended Audience</b> 
        </h3>
        <p>Our targeted audience is worldwide consumers. We hope to get attention to convince people to start caring about environmental issues. Although pollution is such a global issue, we believe that change can start with the people. If people care, then governments will care. With this project, we hope to gather attention on this crisis.</p>
